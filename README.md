# odin-recipes
Finally I started my first project with TOP. This is a project of making a website for recipes.

At the end of this project, I'd have demonstrated the following skills:

Use command line in terminal to create, delete, copy, move (or rename) file and directory

Use git through terminal to clone and push file to github

Create repository on github to pull file to my local mac

Add file to staging area (git add .)

Commit file in staging area (git commit -m)

Push file to github (git push)

Open file(s) in current directory by using the "code ." command

Save git commit in text editor: type esc (depend); :wq (:=command; w=write(save); q=quit)

git repository is just a collection of git commit (all version of my code)
